# Conversational_QA_CoQA

In this project we observed the performance of
four different encoder-decoder models on a task 
of question-answering on the CoQA dataset. We studied the effect
of the model architecture and specification, the
effect of providing the history of the dialogues
to the models, possible causes for the errors and
shortages, and patterns of mistakes observed in
the models.
